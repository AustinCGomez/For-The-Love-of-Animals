# Temporary Name: For-The-Love-of-Animals
## Idea:
This is a Django project that will serve as a news aggregator. We will pull in news about animals from a variety of sources and also articles written by our staff.
### Goal 1: 
I wish to make this project as production ready as possible. As in, when the project launces to production, anyone can easily submit pull requests for bugs. 
### Goal 2: 
I wish to have a strong testing suite for the application. 

### All changes will be made on the development branch. The main branch shall not be updated until an Alpha version is released. There is limited thing that y ou can do at thi very moment to contribute to the project. Pleae stayed tuned!
